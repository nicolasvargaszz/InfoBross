# InfoBross
Below is a **sample README** file you can include in your Python + Pygame “Mario-Like” project. It uses **GitHub-flavored Markdown** styling, includes **emojis** for a fun vibe, and outlines how to build/run the game, its features, and how to customize assets.

Feel free to adapt and expand it to match your specific repository/project structure!

# Mario-Like Platformer (Python + Pygame) &nbsp;:video_game: :mushroom:

> A fun **2D platformer** built with **Python** and **Pygame**, inspired by classic Mario.  
> Enemies roam the level **invincibly** and harm the player on collision. Collect items, avoid falling off, and survive each level!

## Features :star:
- **Multiple Levels**: Progress through several large maps with different layouts.  
- **Invincible Enemies**: They **cannot** be killed and move continuously, so watch out!  
- **Parallax Background**: Two scrolling layers add depth to the visuals.  
- **Tile-based**: Each level is composed of ASCII layouts converted to tile sprites.  
- **Classic Platforming**: Jumping, collision, gravity, HP system, and “Game Over” mechanics.  
- **Extended**: HP-lives system, bigger levels, textual ASCII maps for easy editing.

---

## Installation & Setup :wrench:
1. **Clone** this repository or **download** the `.zip`:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/mario-like-game.git
   cd mario-like-game
   ```
2. **Install Pygame** (Python 3 recommended):
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```
3. **Place** the required images in the project folder (or you’ll see placeholders):
   - `mario.png`  
   - `goomba.png`  
   - `background_far.png`  
   - `background_near.png`  
   - `tile_ground.png`  
   - `tile_brick.png`  
   - `tile_question.png`  
   - `tile_sky.png`  
   - (Optional) `tile_pipe.png`, etc. if your code references more tile types.

---

## How to Run :arrow_forward:
1. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project’s directory.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   python improved_mario_game.py
   ```
   or whatever your main script’s name is, e.g.:
   ```bash
   python mario_invincible_enemies.py
   ```
3. Enjoy the game! :sparkles:

## Controls :joystick:
| Key        | Action                      |
|------------|-----------------------------|
| **Left**   | Move left                   |
| **Right**  | Move right                  |
| **Space**  | Jump (if on ground)         |
| **Esc**    | Quit the game               |

- **Enemies** are invincible: **any** contact **damages** the player.  
- If HP < 0 or you fall off the map => **Game Over**.

## Game Structure & Assets :game_die:
- **`improved_mario_game.py`** or `mario_invincible_enemies.py`: The main game file containing:
  - **Initialization** (Pygame setup, constants)  
  - **Classes** (`Player`, `Enemy`, `Tile`)  
  - **Level data** (ASCII maps)  
  - **Main loop** for updates and rendering  
- **Assets**:  
  - Background images (e.g., `background_far.png`, `background_near.png`)  
  - **Sprite** images for the player (`mario.png`), enemies (`goomba.png`), and tiles (`tile_ground.png`, `tile_brick.png`, etc.)  
- **Dependencies**: `pygame` (installed via `pip`)

---

## How to Customize :sparkles:
1. **Level Layouts**  
   - Edit the ASCII arrays in your `.py` script(s).  
   - Characters typically used:  
     - `#` for ground blocks  
     - `B` for bricks  
     - `?` for question blocks  
     - `G` for Goombas (enemies)  
     - `M` for the player spawn location  
     - `.` for sky (empty)  
2. **Sprites/Images**  
   - Replace `mario.png` with your own character sprite.  
   - Provide real tile images for a better look.  
   - Adjust sizes in the code if needed (e.g., `TILE_SIZE = 32`).  
3. **Enemy Behavior**  
   - The example code has them patrol left-right or chase.  
   - Tweak `ENEMY_SPEED`, AI logic, etc. for different behavior.  
4. **Difficulty**  
   - Increase level sizes, add more enemies, or reduce the player’s HP/lives.  
   - Make new levels or adjust tile placements for more challenge.
